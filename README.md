Based on Connor Mcgarr's blog "Exploit Development: No Code Execution? No Problem! Living The Age of VBS, HVCI, and Kernel CFG". Thanks to Connor for your blog. I learn a lot!


Note: This is not finished and since I am unable to download WMVare to test this with a Windows machine that has HVCI on. Also this is not a HVCI bypass but a new way to execute a different
type of shellcode as connor mention in his blog.


Compiling:

This should be simple and stright forward. You will need Visual Studio. Once you have downloaded visual studio, open cmd, find vcvars64.bat and run that, once you have done that you can go
to the hvci folder and type build and press enter and it should build with no problems.


Running:
In order to run this, you will need Dell BIOS driver installed. Since the dell bios can be used as a weapon, I will not provide it, you must find it yourself and use it for research.
